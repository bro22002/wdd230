        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            <span>UXPERT</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.uxpert.com/">uxpert.com</a>
          </p>
          <img src="./images/uxpert.png" alt="screenshot of uxpert homepage" />
          <p>
            The logos are aligned horizontally and vertically pairs. They are
            horizontally aligned in composition making them visually appealing.
            This makes it simple and easy to understand. While you probably
            won't notice when the elements in a design are aligned, you will
            almost definitely notice when they aren't. A design with poor
            alignment will look cluttered and unfinished.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alignment is the placement of visual elements so they line up in
            composition. In design, we use alignment to organize elements, group
            elements, create balance, create structure, create connections
            between elements, to create a sharp and clear outcome.

        <h3>White Space</h3>
        <p>
          <span>Ensign College</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.ensign.edu/">ensign.edu</a>
        </p>
        <img
          src="./images/ensign-college.png"
          alt="screenshot of Ensing College homepage"
        />
        <p>
          Ensign College has good use of white space around the elements of the
          page. This allows users to breathe and stay focused by reducing the
          amount of text and functional elements users see at once. The
          effective use of white space on the page has led to a clean and
          appealing design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whitespace not only creates harmony, and balance, and helps to brand
          design, it can also be used to lead a reader from one element to
          another. The main goals are to make the website look simple and
          uncluttered and to deliver information that readers will enjoy and
          appreciate.

        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <p>
          <span>Airbnb</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">airbnb.com</a>
        </p>
        <img src="./images/airbnb.png" alt="screenshot of Airbnb homepage" />
        <p>
          In the screenshot above, we can see that contrast has been applied to
          visual elements in a different composition. This has increased impact
          and creates exciting graphics and visual interest in the context of
          the page. The choice of colors on the page has created a balance,
          rhythm, and pattern with the other elements of the page. The
          differences make various elements stand out and draw viewers'
          attention to the content of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrast. As a principle of art, contrast refers to the arrangement of
          opposite elements and effects. For example, light and dark colors,
          smooth and rough textures, and large and small shapes. Contrast can be
          used to create variety, visual interest, and drama in an artwork.
