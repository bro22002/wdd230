            The Cape Coast Chamber of Commerce (CCC) is an association of business
            operators, firms, and industries with interests spanning every sector of
            private enterprise in the Central Region, Cape Coast, Ghana. As an
            advocacy organization, the Cape Coast Chamber of Commerce was
            established with the prime objective of promoting and protecting
            commercial and industrial interests in the country, especially in the
            Central Region of Ghana.
        </p>

            The Chamber represents the voice of the business community in the
            Central Region of Ghana with a total commitment to playing a leadership
            role in propelling Ghana's economy to higher heights. As an autonomous

            government policies and programs, which will inure to the benefit of the
            private sector while promoting the overall development of the Ghanaian
            economy. Our vision is to provide leadership for the growth and
            prosperity of businesses in Ghana.
